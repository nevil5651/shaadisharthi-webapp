## 🎯 Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

#### Admin Login Flow
- **Secure URL**: Admins access the panel via a dedicated, non-public URL.
- **Login Form**: Requires Email, Password, and a 6-digit TOTP.
- **First-Time Login**:
  - System generates a QR code for admins to set up TOTP in an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator).
  - After setup, the admin is redirected to the login page.
- **Normal Login**: Authenticates using email, password, and the current TOTP code.

#### Progressive Lockout (Anti-Brute-Force)
- **3 failed attempts** → lock for 28 seconds.
- **4 failed attempts** → lock for 117 seconds.
- **5 failed attempts** → lock for 1 hour.

#### Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)
- A 6-digit code that rotates every 30 seconds ensures secure access.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Supports 3–4 distinct admin roles with different permissions.
- Each API request is verified with a JWT to check the admin's role and grant or deny access.
- Unauthorized attempts result in an “Insufficient Role Privileges” error.

### 🖥️ Dashboard
- **Header**: Displays Admin Name, Account Settings/Profile link, and a Sign Out button.
- **Sidebar**: Navigation links are dynamically rendered based on the admin's role permissions.
- **Widgets & Charts**:
  - Total Customers & Service Providers.
  - User registration trends (year-over-year).
  - Order volume comparison (current vs. previous year).
  - Service category distribution pie chart.

### 👤 My Profile
- View and edit personal details: Full Name, Phone Number, Email, and Address.
- Change password (requires entering the current password for verification).

### 📂 Customer Management
- **Customer List**: A paginated table showing Customer ID, Name, Registration Date, and Actions.
- **Actions**:
  - **View**: Modal displays full customer details.
  - **Edit**: Modify customer information like phone and address.
  - **Delete**: Remove a customer from the platform.
- **Search**: Filter customers by ID, Name, Phone, or Email.

### 🏢 Service Provider Management
- **Provider List**: A paginated table showing Provider Name, Registration Date, Status, and Actions.
- **Status Types**:
  - `Basic Registered`: Signed up with email and password only.
  - `Pending Approval`: Submitted business details and awaiting admin verification.
  - `Approved`: Verified and active on the platform.
- **Actions**:
  - **View**: Modal displays full provider details, including business info (GST, Aadhaar, PAN).
  - **Edit/Delete**: Manage provider accounts.
- **Approval Workflow**:
  - Admins can filter to see only providers with `Pending Approval` status.
  - **Approve**: Updates status and sends an approval email notification.
  - **Reject**: Requires a reason for rejection, which is included in a notification email.
- **Search**: Filter providers by Name, Email, or Phone.

### 📨 Query Management
- **Query Queue**: A table lists user queries with status (Pending/Resolved), assigned admin, and other details.
- **Smart Assignment**:
  - Queries are loaded based on RBAC and status (`Pending`).
  - A query is assignable if it's unassigned, was assigned to another admin over 10 minutes ago, or is already assigned to the current admin.
- **Reply Flow**:
  - Clicking "View" assigns the query to the current admin if available.
  - Only the assigned admin can reply.
  - The reply is stored, and an email notification is sent to the user.

### 🔑 Forgot Password
- Admins can reset their password by entering their email to receive a secure token.
